# BlockFund – A Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform

## 📖 Project Description
BlockFund is a simple, secure, and transparent crowdfunding smart contract built on Ethereum.  
It allows project creators to raise funds directly from supporters using blockchain technology.  
Contributors can send Ether to help the project reach its funding goal, and once the target is achieved,  
the project owner can withdraw the collected funds.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
To revolutionize traditional crowdfunding by creating a decentralized, trustless, and transparent platform  
where innovators and backers can interact directly without relying on intermediaries or centralized systems.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Decentralized Contributions:** Anyone can contribute Ether directly to the smart contract.  
- **Automatic Fund Locking:** Funds remain in the contract until the funding goal is met.  
- **Secure Withdrawals:** Only the project owner can withdraw funds after reaching the goal.  
- **Transparent Ledger:** Every transaction is visible on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- **Refund Mechanism:** Add a feature allowing contributors to reclaim funds if the goal isn’t met by a deadline.  
- **Multiple Campaigns:** Extend the contract to manage several crowdfunding projects at once.  
- **Front-End DApp:** Build a React or Next.js interface for easy interaction.  
- **NFT/Token Rewards:** Implement contributor reward systems using ERC-721 or ERC-20 tokens.
